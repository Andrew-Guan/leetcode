method1:

1. Nothing special. But I need to put forward more test cases by myself to verify the code.

method2:

1. It's faster. 
2. It use string.charAt(index) instead of string array(string[] array = s.split(""));
2. Comparing with the method1, it compares the remaining part of string. So it is faster.
