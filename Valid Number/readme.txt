method1:

I use state machine to do the design. Due to the specific requirement from the test cases, the design is very trivial. 

method2:

It uses regular expression matching. 

method3:

I wrote an regular expression by myself. 

method4:

I wrote method4 based on method3 without using string s = s.trim(); // reduce the space from head and tail
