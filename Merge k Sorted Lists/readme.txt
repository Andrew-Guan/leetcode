method1:

It can work. But it exceed the time limit for the last test case. 

method2:

Based on the method1, it updates k lists together, it takes 406 ms.
It is not fast. 

method3:

It is faster by using priority queue. In the method3, I tried two way to initialize the PriorityQueue. 
If I add all the listnodes at one time, it will exceed the memory limit.
